    <dt>Description</dt>
    <dd>Brian is on his way to Canada to visit his estranged father when the pilot of his small prop plane suffers a heart attack. Brian is forced to crash-land the plane in a lake--and finds himself stranded in the remote Canadian wilderness with only his clothing and the hatchet his mother gave him as a present before his departure. Brian had been distraught over his parents' impending divorce and the secret he carries about his mother, but now he is truly desolate and alone...</dd>

    <dd>Some books imprint themselves on your mind and stay with you. You can remember vividly where you were when you first read them. Hatchet is one of those books for me. I remember being in Mrs. Alison’s sixth grade class, and this book was raging though the male half of my class like a wildfire. Even boys who usually hated reading couldn’t put it down. Obviously, as the class’s self-proclaimed queen of the bookworms, I wanted to know what all the fuss was about. So, when a copy finally made it back to the book cubbies that lined the back of the classroom, I nabbed it. And I totally saw what the fuss was about.Survival stories have been popular for centuries. Robinson Crusoe, Kidnapped, The Swiss Family Robinson; even The Odyssey had survival aspects. So what was so special about Hatchet? It was the story of a thirteen-year-old plane-crash victim struggling to survive in the Canadian wilderness. Alone. With nothing but his hatchet.This was a main character who was close to our age. Who was struggling to accept the recent divorce of his parents, which was something that multiple kids in our class were going through, and that the rest of us feared...</dd>

<h1 id="thedataweused">The data we used</h1>

<p>We used a subset of Goodbooks-10k from Github, which contains most rated books, their user ratings and all the tags users give them. However we wanted even more information so we can delve into text analysis. Therefore we wrote a python script to download and extract book descriptions and reviews directly from Goodreads.
In total it is around X MB of data. You can download <a href="https://github.com/zygmuntz/goodbooks-10k">Goodbooks-10k</a> and <a href="">CSV</a> with book descriptions and reviews to try to play with the data. If you want to see more details about how we processed and analysed our data, you can find those in the <a href="">Explainer notebook</a>. </p>
